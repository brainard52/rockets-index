# Plan Rockets' Index
##The next things I plan on implementing:

1. Statistics information
    - Counts of card types
    - Counts of each pokemon stage for each color
    - Counts of rule box pokemon for each color
2. Sort by:
    1. Card type:
        1. Pokemon
            1. Color
            2. Has Rule Box - True > False
            3. Stage - Stage 2 > Stage 1 > Basic
                - Note: A Stage 2 will be followed by its own Stage 1 and Basic forms
            4. Alphabetically
            5. 
        2. Supporter
            1. Alphabetically
            2. Set Release
        3. Item
            1. Alphabetically
            2. Set Release
        4. Pokemon Tool
            1. Alphabetically

        6. Special Energy
            1. Alphabetically
            2. Set Release
        7. Basic Energy

## Bugs
- For some reason images sometimes jump to strange places on resize. [Example](https://brainard52.github.io/rockets-index/#IwGmAYA4QdgNgFygJwCYQGYCsSSXCFsrsBtBsaBHCACyRA~=)
